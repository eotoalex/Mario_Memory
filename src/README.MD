## Development
I found working with React to be some what tedious at first, but very simplistic as I moved forward with it. The biggest take seemed to be the randomizing images after each click event, but given the React state of mind, the clicks were listened to in the JSX, so I couldn't use Jquery. I moved into creating an for loop that too in an array to create a temporary array that I can throw around for the sake of puttin temporary array in another function that mutated it based on the characters images that were selected. I did this so that the array could get smaller and smaller until there were no characters left. I considered moving to using a filter array to do this. The goal was to render the images in different sections of the page after each click. I felt like I could have done this better, but I was trying to get it done quickly, in order to get it working and refine the functionality a bit when the application was complete.
